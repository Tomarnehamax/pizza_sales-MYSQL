Introduction:

Hello, my name is Neha Tomar. This project focuses on the management and analysis of pizza sales using SQL queries.
I have developed a database system that handles various aspects of pizza sales, including customer orders, payment tracking,
inventory management, and sales reporting. Through this project, I demonstrate how SQL can be leveraged to efficiently manage business
operations and derive insights from data, such as sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory usage. This project helps businesses
optimize their sales strategies and improve operational efficiency.
